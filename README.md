# Document Compressor Pipeline

## Description
This project is a powerful PDF knowledge extraction tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze and retrieve information from a collection of PDF documents. It splits the text into manageable chunks, embeds the text using HuggingFace's `sentence-transformers`, and stores them in a vector database (Chroma). Advanced retrieval techniques are applied to handle complex queries.
